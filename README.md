Overall this portfolio was rewarding for me since I was able to put into practice the theory that I learned in my algorithm classes, my artificial intelligence classes, and my previous math classes into problems that I formulated or found interesting to tackle. I put together artifacts that ranged from data visualizations to coding computations to problem formulations to algorithm explanations and to proof method explanations.


There are a few artifacts that I would like to highlight. Two of my most ambitious artifacts are 5 and 6. Artifact 5 explains the Branch and Bound (B\&B) algorithm that can be used to solve graph problems efficiently. I was introduced to this algorithm in my AI class, and I was able to tailor it to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) that I saw in my mathematical modelling class. This involved converting the TSP into a graph that can be input into the B\&B algorithm which I explored in artifact 5. Artifact 6 builds on this by putting the theory of artifact 5 into code. In this artifact I showed and explained performance differences when varying choices of heuristics are used in B\&B.


Artifacts 2 and 3 are of different flavours from the rest. Artifact 2 explains how we can use linear programming to model a complicated public transportation problem. On the other hand, artifact 3 involves coding to explore how the runtimes of different linear programming algorithms grow with their problem size. Meanwhile, artifacts 1 and 4 seek to answer questions posed in my mathematical modelling class by implementing algorithms---either the two-phase simplex or a polytope vertex finding algorithm to solve their respective problems. Artifact 7 required more creativity to explain in a simple manner one process for writing NP-Complete proofs, a topic involved in computational complexity theory.
All in all it is hard to pick favourites among these artifacts which were all a joy to produce.


In general, to create quality artifacts I find that it is important to tackle problems that are truly interesting to oneself. I was most motivated to see how my learning of topics from different fields could connect. It was sometimes a challenge connecting these topics because they did not always yield a problem that I could feasibly undertake. Nonetheless, my best works were those that were interdisciplinary in nature.
